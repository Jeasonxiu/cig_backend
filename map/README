DESCRIPTION OF HIT MAPPING TOOLS

This directory contains scripts and data related to recording downloads of CIG
software and creating maps of the download activity. This directory contains three
subdirectories (described below) with files pertaining to the three steps of this
functionality:

    1) analyze Apache logs and record hits in a SQLite database (hit_database/)

    2) generate SQLite database mapping IP addresses to latitude/longitude locations
    (ip_database/)

    3) use the two aforementioned databases with GMT to create maps of download
    activity (map_plot/)

Descriptions of the subdirectories and their files

ip_database/

    generate_ip_database.py
    Requires at least Python 2.6, compatible with Python 3.3.

    Simple Python script to read csv files and convert them to a SQLite
    database. Usage is:

        generate_ip_database.py DB_NAME LOCATION_CSV_FILE BLOCK_CSV_FILE

    GeoLiteCity-Blocks.csv, GeoLiteCity-Location.csv
	CSV files downloaded from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite with
	information for mapping IP addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates.
	These are parsed by the generate_ip_database.py script to create a SQLite3
	database. An example of running these through the script:

    ./generate_ip_database.py ip_lookup_db GeoLiteCity-Location.csv GeoLiteCity-Blocks.csv
    *******************************************************
    WARNING: THIS WILL COMPLETELY DESTROY THE IP LOOKUP
    DATABASE. ONLY RUN IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

    Read 438386 entries from file and added 438386 entries to location table.
    Read 1790461 entries from file and added 1790461 entries to block table.

    (Optional: ip_lookup_db or another database name) SQLite3 database containing
    the converted CSV file contents.

hit_database/

    apachelog.py
	External Python script for parsing Apache access logs.

    reset_hit_db.py
	Python script to reset/create the database recording software hits.
	Also contains the SQLite DB schema for this database.
	Only run if you absolutely know what you are doing.

    parse_log.py
	Python script to parse Apache logs and insert relevant hits into the
	SQLite database. Runs nightly as a cron job.

map_plot/

    plot.py
	Python script to create hit maps using GMT in combination with the recorded
	hit database (hit_database/) and IP-geolocation database (ip_database).
	Runs nightly as a cron job.
