DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE LIST MANAGEMENT

Written by Eric Heien on Apr 15, 2013

This directory contains databases and scripts to track publications written with
the assistance of CIG codes.  Contents of the directory are described below.

cig_endnote_library.xml
    The raw XML output from EndNote. This must be manually exported.

cig_pubs.xml
    The default filename of the publication list after processing by
    process_endnote_xml.py (see below).

format_cig_pubs.xsl
    The XSL script to format the processed XML reference database.

process_endnote_xml.py
    Requires at least Python 2.6, compatible with Python 3.3.

    The XML database exported by EndNote is deficient in several ways that this
    script corrects.  The script removes many extraneous tags and attributes which
    greatly increase the filesize but are irrelevant for display. It also reformats
    DOI related fields so they can be properly used by the XSL script.

    In this directory, the other XML files are run through this script using the
    following command:

	./process_endnote_xml.py cig_endnote_library.xml cig_pubs.xml
